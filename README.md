## Overview

Dealing with raw text output can be tedious and time-consuming. `tsbuddy` parsing aims to simplify this by providing tools to:

1.  **Extract** relevant sections from log files or command outputs.
2.  **Parse** this raw text into structured Python objects.
3.  **Enable** programmatic analysis and decision-making based on the parsed data.

This allows you to quickly turn unstructured command output into actionable insights.

## Key Features

*   **Log Section Extraction:** Easily isolate specific command outputs or sections from larger log files.
*   **Structured Data Parsing:** Convert unstructured log text into Python objects for easy manipulation. (Simple example below).
*   **Simplified Diagnostics:** Build custom logic on top of parsed data to automate checks, generate reports, trigger alerts or actions.
*   **Developer-Friendly:** Designed to be easily integrated into existing Python scripts and workflows.

## Installation

You can install `tsbuddy` via pip:

```bash
pip install tsbuddy
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to use `tsbuddy` to parse temperature information from command output. 

### Basic Example: Parsing Temperature Data

For this example, we will use a file named `tech_support.log` in your working directory.

**1. Import `tsbuddy` and `pprint`:**

```python
import tsbuddy as ts
from pprint import pprint
```

**2. Read your log file:**

(For this example, we'll simulate reading from the file. `tsbuddy` itself can work on any source of text.)

```python
# Example content for 'tech_support.log'
# This would typically be read from an actual file
file_text = """
Some initial lines...
show system, show chassis, etc

show temperature
Chassis/Device   Current Range      Danger Thresh Status
---------------- ------- ---------- ------ ------ ---------------
1/CMMA       45      15 to 60   68     60     UNDER THRESHOLD
3/CMMA       46      15 to 60   68     60     UNDER THRESHOLD
4/CMMA       46      15 to 60   68     60     UNDER THRESHOLD


Some other lines...
show ip interface, etc
...
"""

# If you were reading from a file:
# file = "tech_support.log"
# with open(file, encoding='utf-8') as f:
#     file_text = f.read()
```

**3. Extract the relevant section:**

The `extract_section` function helps you get the raw text for a specific command or section.

```python
# Extract the section containing "show temperature" output
# (The exact implementation of extract_section will determine how it identifies the section's end)
temp_section_text = ts.extract_section(file_text, "show temperature")
# print("--- Raw Extracted Text ---")
# print(temp_section_text)
```

**4. Parse the raw text into a structured format:**

`tsbuddy` provides parsers for specific commands. Here, we use `parse_temperature`.

```python
# Parse the raw temperature text to structured data
parsed_temps = ts.parse_temperature(temp_section_text)

print("--- Parsed Temperature Data ---")
pprint(parsed_temps, sort_dicts=False)
```

This will output:

```
--- Parsed Temperature Data ---
[{'Chassis/Device': '1/CMMA',
  'Current': '45',
  'Range': '15 to 60',
  'Danger': '68',
  'Thresh': '60',
  'Status': 'UNDER THRESHOLD'},
 {'Chassis/Device': '3/CMMA',
  'Current': '46',
  'Range': '15 to 60',
  'Danger': '68',
  'Thresh': '60',
  'Status': 'UNDER THRESHOLD'},
 {'Chassis/Device': '4/CMMA',
  'Current': '46',
  'Range': '15 to 60',
  'Danger': '68',
  'Thresh': '60',
  'Status': 'UNDER THRESHOLD'}]
```

**5. Work with the structured data:**

Now that the data is structured, you can easily access and process it.

```python
# Request data from specific fields
print("\n--- Device Statuses ---")
for chassis in parsed_temps:
    print(chassis["Status"])
```

Output:

```
--- Device Statuses ---
UNDER THRESHOLD
UNDER THRESHOLD
UNDER THRESHOLD
```

**6. Add custom logic:**

You can build more complex logic based on the values of specific fields.

```python
print("\n--- Devices with Current Temperature < 46째C ---")
for chassis in parsed_temps:
    if int(chassis["Current"]) < 46:
        print(chassis["Chassis/Device"] + " is less than 46째C")
        pprint(chassis, sort_dicts=False)
```

Output:

```
--- Devices with Current Temperature < 46째C ---
1/CMMA is less than 46째C
{'Chassis/Device': '1/CMMA',
 'Current': '45',
 'Range': '15 to 60',
 'Danger': '68',
 'Thresh': '60',
 'Status': 'UNDER THRESHOLD'}

```

## Future Enhancements (Examples)

The `tsbuddy` module is designed to be extensible. Future development could include:

*   More parsers for common log outputs (e.g., `show fabric`, `vrf ... show ...`, `debug show ...`).
*   Functions to compare states (e.g., before/after changes).
*   Integration with alerting systems.
*   Parse configuration.
*   Convert configurations.
*   Auto-detect parsing function.
*   Generate tech-support & validate generation.
*   Support outputting to MS Excel.
*   Support for different log formats & devices.
*   More sophisticated section extraction logic.
